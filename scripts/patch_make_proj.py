# patch_make_proj.py — patch make_proj.tcl for cloud batch builds.
#
# Injects an IP import block after the source-file add step, which is
# the batch-mode equivalent of the manual GUI step:
#   "Add Sources → import_ip/ → Copy sources checked"
#
# This is needed because --regen_ip is broken in Vivado 2024.2, and the
# GUI step is not performed in headless builds.
#
# See docs/vivado-batch-ip-handling.md for full explanation.
#
# Usage: python3 patch_make_proj.py <path/to/make_proj.tcl>
